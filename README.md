## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher (Python 3.13 compatible)
- Webcam (for real-time recognition)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanketKumarKar/face-recognition-project
cd face-recognition-project
```

### Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment

#### Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Special Instructions for Different Operating Systems:

##### Windows:
- If you encounter issues with dlib installation, install CMake first:
  ```cmd
  pip install cmake
  pip install dlib
  ```
- Make sure Visual C++ build tools are installed ([Download here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/))

##### macOS:
- You might need to install XCode Command Line Tools:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- If you encounter dlib installation errors, try:
  ```bash
  pip install cmake
  pip install dlib
  ```

##### Linux:
- Install the following packages before installing requirements:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev python3-dev
  ```
- If you encounter dlib installation errors, try:
  ```bash
  pip install cmake
  pip install dlib
  ```
- dlib may not support Python 3.12+ yet. Use Python 3.8â€“3.11 for best compatibility.

### Step 4: Download the Face Recognition Model (Optional)

The application will work without a pre-trained model, but will only detect faces without recognizing them.

To include face recognition:
1. Place your trained model file in the project root directory
2. For PyTorch models, name it `face_recognition_model.pt`

## Quick Start (Linux, Windows, macOS)

### Linux
1. Install system dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev python3-dev
   ```
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Windows
1. Install [Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```cmd
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install CMake and dlib if you have issues:
   ```cmd
   pip install cmake
   pip install dlib
   ```
4. Install Python dependencies:
   ```cmd
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the app:
   ```cmd
   python app.py
   ```

### macOS
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Web Application

1. Activate your virtual environment if it's not already activated
2. Start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Using the Web Interface

1. **Live Face Recognition**:
   - The home page shows your webcam feed with real-time face detection
   - Detected faces will be highlighted with a blue rectangle
   - If a trained model is loaded, recognized faces will be labeled

2. **Take Snapshots**:
   - Click the "Take Snapshot" button to capture the current frame
   - Snapshots will be saved in the `static/snapshots` directory

3. **Process Video Files**:
   - Click "Choose File" to select a video for processing
   - Click "Upload" to process the video
   - Results will be displayed after processing completes

## Training Your Own Model

To train the system to recognize specific faces:

1. Collect images of faces you want to recognize
2. Organize them into folders, one folder per person
3. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py --data_dir path/to/face/images
```

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Access Issues
- Make sure your browser has permission to access the camera
- Close other applications that might be using your camera

### Model Loading Issues
- Verify that your model file is in the correct format for PyTorch
- Check console logs for specific error messages

### Installation Problems
- For dlib issues, make sure you have the proper build tools installed (see above OS-specific instructions)
- If you see `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'dlib'`, ensure dlib installed successfully:
  ```bash
  pip install dlib
  ```
- If installation fails, check your Python version (dlib may not support Python 3.12+)
- Use `pip install -v` for verbose output to identify specific errors
- For Windows, ensure Visual C++ build tools are installed
- For macOS, ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed
